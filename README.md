# Advent of Code 2018

## About

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2018. 

All of solutions are written in C#. I'm also attempting to write unit tests for each of the solutions.

I am targeting .NET Core 2.1, so this project should be cross-platform compatible.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming 
puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any 
programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, 
company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge 
each other.
